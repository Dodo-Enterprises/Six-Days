print("You enter the Mecha Kingdom. "
      "You see a huge plane with a beautiful sky. It was hard to believe that this is a land that no one leaves.")
print("When you look around, you see a little town. "
      "Surprisingly, you see some people working on the land from a far distance. ")
print("You: Didn’t Muriel say that the people evacuated due to the king’s order? "
      "You walk to the town with little questions. ")
print("By the time you reach the town, you are able to see people a lot closer. You are surprised at their appearance. "
      "They are humans made out of metal! ")
print("You: What is going on here??? ")
print("One of the men who are working in the field sees you. ")
print("Mecha man 1: You have real flesh! How did you survive the king’s artifact???")
print("You: What do you mean by surviving the king's artifact? Didn’t all the citizens evacuate?")
print("Mecha man 1: Yes, that is what is known to the public. "
      "But the truth is that the king when the demon king attacked our kingdom, "
      "used his artifact to turn everyone in the kingdom into cyborgs. ")
print("You: How dare he! What happened next?")
print("Mecha Man 1: Then the king built a watch tower to look over everyone. "
      "When he sees something else than a cyborg, he strikes his magic to kill it. My name is James.")
print(" Come to my house you need to hide, or the king will find you and kill you! "
      "You follow James, and James brings you to his house. At James’ house, you see two other mecha men.")
print("James: This is Peter, the fisherman. Also, he is the strongest man in the town. You see Peter.")
print("Peter is a man with a lot of hair and a curly mustache. Also, you are able to see his bulky muscles.")
print("James: This other man is John. He is very smart. Probably the wisest man in the town.")
print("John was a very tall skinny man.When you saw Peter and John, they looked very angry. "
      "Soon, realize the reason why.")
print("Peter: What are you doing James?! Are you stupid? You brought a non-cyberized man. "
      "No one is allowed to be organic except the king! Did you not see what happened to Andrew two years ago? "
      "When the king found out Andrew hid a normal man, the king killed the man with everyone in Andrew’s family! "
      "Andrew, his wife, children, and even the cousins were killed! Leave him out and let him die by himself.")
print("John: James, don’t take Peter’s word in your heart. He said that since he cares about you. Please forgive him. "
      "However, Peter is right about bringing man into our house. We have family and friends, James. "
      "Please leave the man alone. Let the king decide his fate. ")
print("James: No I can’t let him go. I cannot let any more men die in this kingdom by the king. "
      "Okay, then I will bring him to the cabin at the top of the hill. I will be back soon. ")
print("Peter: What is wrong with you James? Just leave him alone. ")
print("John: Okay go and put him in the cabin. Then, you need to come back alone. Let’s live a normal life.")
print("James: Thank you John, and I am sorry Peter. I cannot let anyone die anymore. James drags you out of the house. "
      "You follow him and start to walk up to the hill. The hill was far away from the town. "
      "At the top of the hill, you are able to see the town clearly. ")
print("James: Isn’t it beautiful? I am sorry. As you heard from Peter, many died helping non-cyber people like you. "
      "Please understand them. There are good people in their hearts.")
print("You entered the cabin with James.")
print("James: Here is some food to eat. You can stay here for about 20 days. "
      "Meanwhile, find a way to run away from the kingdom. Boom! You hear a loud sound nearby. "
      "When you exit the cabin, you see the town burned down by the king. ")
print("James: No! Peter, John!")
print("James starts to run down the hill. You follow James to the town. At James’s house, you see Peter injured. ")
print("James: Peter! Peter! What happened? Where is John? What happened? ")
print("Peter: It is all your fault! You killed John. You killed everyone in the town. Peter goes silent. "
      "James mourns for his loss, but no tears came out from the machine’s eyes.")
print("You: Are you okay? ")
print("James: Leave me alone! You killed my friends. Why did you come here?! Everything is your fault! ")
print("That night, the rain came to the town. "
      "You leave James alone and stay at one of the destroyed houses in the town. "
      "The rain ran down James’s face.")
print("The next day, when you wake up and start to pack up to leave the town, James comes to you.")
print("James: I am sorry for yesterday. But I want to know the reason you came to this kingdom. ")
print("You explained everything to James.  "
      "You fought in the crystal kingdom, and your goal is to collect all the artifacts to kill the demon king. ")
print("James: So you are trying to take the artifact from the king. Let me help you. "
      "I know the location of the entrance of the king's watch tower. I worked there before I came to this town")
print("Let me help you so that I may avenge John and Peter. You started to walk with James to the king’s watch tower. "
      "You are attacked by cyberized guards!")
'#Three Battles will occur here'
print("After a while, you finally make it to the king’s tower. "
      "In front of the tower, there are many guards protecting the watchtower.")
print("James: There are too many guards. I will lure them. Go inside the watchtower and kill the guards.")
print("James jumps into the middle of the guards. Then James starts to run away. "
      "Most of the guards start to follow James and only a few guards remain at the entrance.")
'#Battle Against Two Guards'
print("After fighting against the guards, you enter the king’s watch tower. "
      "The tower is very tall that you cannot see the end of it. ")
print("At the top of the tower, you finally meet the king.")
print("Wingard Levioso: You are finally here the man with flesh. "
      "You will die like everyone in the town who tried to help you! ")
'#Boss Battle'
print("You stab your weapon into Wingard Levioso’s heart. However, Wingard Levioso remains alive. ")
print("Wingard Levioso: Did you think you could kill me? There’s no flesh nor blood within this cloak to kill. "
      "There is only one idea. And ideas are weapon-proof. The flesh cannot defeat my ideas. "
      "Everything needs to turn into machines for time is limited to flesh and machines are everlasting. "
      "You cannot kill me you fool. You will also die like your friend here. ")
print("Wingard Levioso brings James in front of you. ")
print("James: Please, for John and for Peter…")
print("Wingard Levioso squeezes James’ head. Soon, James’ head exploded. ")
print("Wingard Levioso: You think your friend can run away from my army? "
      "Everyone who helps you will die along with you. ")
'Boss Battle 2'
print("Wingard Levioso: No, no. Why was my idea not unstoppable? Why? ")
print("You took The Armor of Construction from Wingard Levioso. ")
print("You look at James’s lifeless body and mourn. You are then determined to bring an end to all of this.")
'Go back to town and talk to NPCs'
print("Muriel: Oh welcome back, [player]! "
      "With that fire in your eyes, I can already tell that you conquered another kingdom. Which one was it?")
print("Oh, it was the Mecha kingdom ")
print("Please …tell me, what happened with the king")
print("Player explains everything")
print("Levioso, oh how far you’ve fallen.")
print("Just when I thought he had only abandoned us for his own selfish pride, "
      "he ended up forcefully changing all of the citizens into machines. ")
print("Muriel falls to the floor and starts the cry. Ragnar then comes downstairs.")
print("Ragnar: Levioso was once a great friend of ours. "
      "We had personally recommended him to the high deity in order to become the ruler of the mecha kingdom. "
      "After all this time, he had only gotten worse. ")
print("I’m so sorry Muriel and you [player] for having to deal with him I should have been a better judge of character")
print("That leaves only one kingdom left to go Keep going kid, you're in the endgame now!")
