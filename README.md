# Battle_Instances.txt Guidelines
# Each line is a specific battle instance. The line number denotes the index number you pass to the load_battle_from_file method
# The main things need to be written down are allies, enemies, and the run_difficulty
# if there is no allies than put "null" in its place, same goes for the run_difficulty
# Template with all parameters
# ally1_name, health, job_type, [spell_1, spell_2, spell_3], [potion_1], [item_1, item_2], arm1, arm2, helmet, breastplate, grieves enemy1_name, health, job_type, [], [potion_1, potion_2], [], arm1, arm2, helmet, breastplate, grieves run_difficulty
